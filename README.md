## Auto SBC-Toolbox
This is a mash up of two foundry modules, in order to create a massive monster bestiary.
I'll add more to this later.
## This is based off of two other modules (Stat block importer https://github.com/Lavaeolous/Foundry-PF1-StatBlock-Converter and auto-sbc-toolbox https://github.com/SvenWerlen/fvtt-auto-sbc-toolbox)

To use: Install this module, and open just as if you were using the data toolbox (by importing the show toolbox macro).
For source data file, use `Bestiary.csv`, and don't bother using a template (haven't removed it, but it isn't used).

Then keep an eye on the console, and debug as you please. Eventually a compendium is created.
